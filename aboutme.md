subtitle: Software Developer Down Under

Hi, my name is Ryan Santos. I'm a Software Developer living in Melbourne Australia. 
I started my career in the Philippines and moved to Australia in 2008. I work primarily with C#, ASP.NET & ASP.NET Core
to help build amazing software.


When I'm not coding or learning new coding techniques, I enjoy playing guitar, walking and trying out the best coffee of Melbourne.



### About this blog 
I created this blog to help me keep up with latest in the .NET world. 
Here I will document my journey as I learn ASP.NET Core, Blazor and the problems I encounter along the way. 


As I'm always learning and there is so much to learn in software development. 
I hope this blog will provide useful information to those learners out there.
