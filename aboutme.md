Hi, my name is Ryan Santos. I'm a Software Developer living in Melbourne Australia. 
I started my career in the Philippines and moved to Australia in 2008. I work primarily with C#, ASP.NET & ASP.NET Core
to help build amazing software.


When I'm not coding or learning new coding techniques, I enjoy playing guitar, walking and catching up with friends.
