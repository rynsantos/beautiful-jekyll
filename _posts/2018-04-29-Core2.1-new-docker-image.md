title: New docker image for ASP.NET Core 2.1 
---

Today while converting my web app from ASP.NET 2.0 to 2.1 Preview2, I notice that the docker file needs to point to the new docker image.
The following docker images has been depracated.

- microsoft/aspnetcore-build:1.0-1.1
- microsoft/aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0

According to the github issue and I quote `These images will continue to receive patch update whenever a 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 2.0.x update ships, however, we will not produce a new version which contains the 2.1 runtime`.

#### ASP.NET Core 2.1 Dockerfile
Now to point my web app to the new docker image just need to update the docker file to this.

- `microsoft/aspnetcore:<version>` now points to `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-aspnetcore-runtime`
